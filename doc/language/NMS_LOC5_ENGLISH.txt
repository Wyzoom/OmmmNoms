ALL_PORTALQUEST_WORD_DESC_1	{The stone responds to my presence, seeming to anticipate what I seek. The carvings waver and refract, as though submerged in liquid...}
ALL_PORTALQUEST_WORD_DESC_2	{The face of this stone, streaked by dark stains, suggests a strange history. It is as though once, long ago, it rested deep on the ocean floor.}
ALL_PORTALQUEST_WORD_DESC_3	{The carvings on the stone blur before my eyes, distant and cloudy, as though viewed through a thick pane of glass.}
ALL_PORTALQUEST_WORD_DESC_4	{This Knowledge stone appears to be rapidly shifting between two positions, perhaps vibrating. My eyes ache as I try to focus.}

ALL_PORTALQUEST_WORD_RES_2	{Something viscous clings to my glove. Although the carvings themselves are long eroded, the nature of the stone's inscription, suddenly becomes obvious, imprinted for eternity in the grime: a short sequence of glyphs.}
ALL_PORTALQUEST_WORD_RES_3	{The glassy membrane ripples as my hand passes through it. The stone sings, and I suddenly find I can read the partial glyph sequence...}
ALL_PORTALQUEST_WORD_RES_4	{Touching the stone further confuses my senses. It is not vibrating, but almost seems to exist twice, doubled up, overlapping its twin.
With this thought, I concentrate on a single iteration of the stone, and manage to make out a sequence of glyphs. A fragment of a portal code.}
ALL_PORTALQUEST_WORD_RES_5	{Relief sweeps over me as the pitch of the sound bends, becoming a pleasant and harmonious musical chord. In my mind, each note of the chord associates itself with the shape of a glyph.}

They tell me I will be betrayed. They tell me I will become a betrayer, too.}

FTH_EXOTIC2_PQ_BLD_RES_A_19	{Would that our brethren shared your spirit!}
FTH_EXOTIC2_PQ_BLD_RES_C_19	{You are right. Our task here is more important than ever.}
FTH_EXOTIC2_PQ_BLD_RES2_A_19	{Hesperus is avoiding us. They've been travelling into Korvax space, more and more.

I fear for them, that they may be planning something dangerous. And this is no time for secrets...

Will you follow them? Find their coordinates, follow the knowledge stones. The portal will show you the way.}
FTH_EXOTIC2_PQ_BLD_RES_B_19	{Please, trace the knowledge stones to the corruption site. Follow the portals. Find Hesperus. I fear for them...}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_19	{My sensors detect the remnants of a thousand Korvax souls, spread all across this system.

They tried to simulate the Abyss. They succeeded only in gaining its attention.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_19A	{

It will take much to heal this void. Without sustenance, it will devour system upon system...}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_RES_19	{The rift healed, I discover the origin of the experiment. 

Hesperus had been working with the Korvax... had been trying to solve our predicament.

Their failure here has caused devastation to this species. I do not know if my friend survived...}
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_LANG_20	{Calamity has befallen us, Portal-Adept. A thousand Korvax souls have been severed from the Convergence.

The result of a fellow Traveller's ambition exceeding their grasp. Hesperus was working with the Korvax to try to simulate the Abyss itself. It came for them instead.

If Hesperus returns to us, do you believe we can still trust them? They have much to answer for.}
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_OPT_A_20	{Declare your trust}
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_OPT_C_20	{Shake your head}
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_RES_A_20	{I hope you are right, Portal-Adept.}
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_RES_C_20	{This pains me, Portal-Adept. Though I fear you may be correct.}
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_RES2_A_20	{Ariadne says we cannot afford to lose hope, not now. These anomalies continue to spread...

Knowledge stones will lead the way. It is all we can hope to do. 

You will find the next incursion through a portal. }
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_RES_B_20	{The knowledge stones will light your path, Portal-Adept. Go. Do what I cannot.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_20	{The corruption welcomes me, claiming that it has met me, time and time again.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_20A	{I hear its static in my mind, now. It demands gifts. It claims to have given me so many...}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_RES_20	{The anomaly ceases. I think back to Mercury's doubts... to the failures of Hesperus...

My fellow Travellers are doing their best. We must help each other, I know.

And with the thought, another slithers down my spine. It is not my own. It is a voice within me.

I must <STELLAR>help it<>.}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_CRA_DESC_11	{Tethys seems uneasy. Their lidless eyes flick towards Mercury's empty post.}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_CRA_LANG_11	{Tell me. Do you ever feel lonely? }
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_CRA_OPT_A_11	{Say everyone does}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_CRA_OPT_C_11	{Say no}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_CRA_RES_A_11	{I'm not everyone, though, am I? I'm supposed to be better...}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_CRA_RES_C_11	{No? Hm. You're bluffing.}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_CRA_RES2_A_11	{They shift uncomfortably.}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_CRA_RES3_A_11	{Perhaps there’s more chance of survival if we travel alone. I don’t know how much longer we will be safe here.
The knowledge stones call to all of us, now. The portals need you.}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_CRA_RES_B_11	{Follow the knowledge stones, go through the portal. I need to make my own preparations.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_CRA_DESC_11	{Corruption boils through the crashed vessel, but somehow the captain’s log is unaffected.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_CRA_DESC_11A	{The pilot was betrayed by one they considered an ally. The Abyss can only take what it is invited to consume. It desires so much more, even now...}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_CRA_RES_11	{The corruption purged, I look more closely at the fallen vessel’s data. The Traveller pilot believed they heard voices, those days prior to the crash.
Whispers from their own Exosuit issued out into the void, bargaining for survival...
I leave, checking my own for signs of tampering or malfunction. All seems as it should be. }
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_GRA_LANG_6	{Ah, kindred... do not fear. All my guilt has been purged from my mind. Nanite Clusters can transform neurons with ease...}
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_GRA_OPT_A_6	{Listen}
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_GRA_RES_A_6	{I helped the Korvax create their simulation of the Abyss. I truly grieve their passing, kindred. But that work alone did not determine their fate!
Someone among us is a traitor... someone led the Abyss to us!
Do you not see? The knowledge stones are being hijacked!
Whoever is behind this betrayal wants us to go through the portals. They want us to feed the anomalies.
Step through the breach once more, kindred. I will try to free us from this terrible loop...}
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_GRA_RES_B_6	{Find the knowledge stones, step through the portal. I will watch and observe...}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_GRA_DESC_6	{The grave crackles with exotic energies. 
The Traveller who once rested here is long gone, harvested by a Mind Arc from another universe. }
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_GRA_DESC_6A	{The grave is a place of unending yearning, now. Its existence demands a tribute of resources. }
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_GRA_RES_6	{The grave is purified. I attempt to find the name of the one who died here, but all I find is a null value.
I depart, troubled. It feels as if someone is watching me... }
FTH_EXOTIC1_PQ_CRA_LANG_12	{Ah, Like-Traveller. You have returned.}
FTH_EXOTIC1_PQ_CRA_DESC_12	{Their face twists into something half-resembling a smile.}
FTH_EXOTIC1_PQ_CRA_OPT_A_12	{Return the smile}
FTH_EXOTIC1_PQ_CRA_OPT_C_12	{Ask for a mission}
FTH_EXOTIC1_PQ_CRA_RES_A_12	{Some believe all Travellers are one entity, split over untold forms and bodies.
I am you, and you are me.
This is why I believe in you, Like-Traveller. If we work together, we can save all that we are.
Knowledge stones are an Atlas-Gift. Who are we to refuse the portals’ call?}
FTH_EXOTIC1_PQ_CRA_RES_B_12	{Follow the knowledge stones, Like-Traveller, and the portal will lead you to our next task.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_CRA_DESC_12	{Devotees of the Atlas came to this world to pray, once.
An anomaly distorts their crashed vessel. It claimed the lives of those within long ago.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_CRA_DESC_12A	{Now the anomaly desires more. It waits for our invitation to depart, for resources to quench its unfathomable thirst.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_CRA_RES_12	{The crashed vessel is purged of all anomalous traces. 
Its log speaks of the Atlas who made all things... even loss. Even hate.
I wonder if, in their final moments, they trusted in their deity. If they hoped for salvation...}
FTH_EXOTIC2_PQ_BLD_DESC_21	{Gemini looks at schematics for Exosuits. They don’t seem to notice my approach...}
FTH_EXOTIC2_PQ_BLD_OPT_A_21	{Greet your friend}
FTH_EXOTIC2_PQ_BLD_RES_A_21	{They hide the schematics, hesitating as they turn to face me. }
FTH_EXOTIC2_PQ_BLD_RES2_A_21	{So much of our lives are mysteries, my friend. The faces we are born with...
The clothes we wear. Who made the Exosuits? Who speaks with their voice? 
The knowledge stones, the portals they lead us through... they are our birthright. 
There is so much out there, still to be found.}
FTH_EXOTIC2_PQ_BLD_RES_B_21	{Follow the knowledge stones, as we always have. It is the right of any Traveller to go through the portals...}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_21	{The structure once housed an artificial intelligence.
Corruption now festers within its shell, hating all that it once was. }
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_21A	{This place desires only matter. It wants me to bring it more.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_RES_21	{I see the final vestiges of the AI as all corruption departs, the final fifteen minutes of its life...
It knew I would come here. It knew I would try to save it. 
Worlds upon worlds seethe in the void. The Abyss spreads. }
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_LANG_22	{These are grim times, Portal-Adept. Our community has fallen to strife.}
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_OPT_A_22	{Ask what is wrong}
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_RES_A_22	{Hesperus has grown paranoid. They refuse to attend our meetings. They shun even Nada and Polo.

You must not become like our former friend. You do such vital work...

The knowledge stones will guide you on your path through the portals. They will show you the path to salvation.}
FTH_EXOTIC3_PQ_BLD_RES_B_22	{Allow the knowledge stones to be your guide. The portals will lead you to salvation.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_22	{The structure has been infected, its anomalous calls echoing through the planet itself.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_22A	{The Abyss requires resources. Without them, this world will be lost forever...}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_RES_22	{I do my duty. The corruption fades. I hear its voice... I feel its feelings...

I feel malice, hatred, despair – all of it directed only against its own self...

I see memories of water...}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_GRA_LANG_7	{Traveller... has your Exosuit been operating at proper capacity? }
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_GRA_OPT_A_7	{Say it has}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_GRA_OPT_C_7	{Say it has not}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_GRA_RES_A_7	{Hm.
I’ve been hearing strange noises from my own suit. Almost like it is whispering.
An associate of mine went to Korvax space to complete an analysis of our signals, but they’ve not returned.
Will you go and find them through the portal? The knowledge stones should show their path.}
FTH_EXOTIC4_PQ_GRA_RES_B_7	{Another associate of mine is missing. Find them through the portal... knowledge stones should lay out your destination. Be quick.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_GRA_DESC_7	{Did a Traveller do this?
There is evidence that a Multi-Tool was fired upon the fallen friend of Tethys, their analysis never completed.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_GRA_DESC_7A	{Around the grave corruption spreads, demanding its tribute.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_GRA_RES_7	{The grave is purified. 
I examine traces of the battle, of the fallen Traveller’s memories.
I see a face that is not a face, an arm raised to fire their weapon.
I see the murderer. 
It is Ariadne.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_GRA_DESC_7B	{<AUDIO>TXT_StaticNoise_Start<>A mossy growth coats this gravesite. Its tiny leaves wriggle excitedly when I move my hand closer. Is this an offering? Something to aid me?<AUDIO>TXT_StaticNoise_End<>}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_GRA_RES_7B	{<AUDIO>TXT_StaticNoise_Start<>The compost falls easily into my hands. It smells sweet, almost appetising.<AUDIO>TXT_StaticNoise_End<>}
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_BLD_LANG_23	{The others will be back soon, kindred. We do not have much time...}
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_BLD_OPT_A_23	{Listen}
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_BLD_RES_A_23	{Ariadne tells us the universe is burning with corruption, that only we Travellers can fight it. 
But these missions... these lies... my kindred, we have been deceived. 
I thought my scans must be wrong. I thought I'd dreamt the whispers I heard in my mind.}
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_BLD_RES2_A_23	{Hesperus shakes, tormented. }
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_BLD_RES3_A_23	{Ariadne crashed their ship some weeks ago. They never returned. The entity who now leads us is an imposter.
Find the knowledge stones, set your path through the portal. See the truth for yourself.}
FTH_EXOTIC5_PQ_BLD_RES_B_23	{Ariadne - the real Ariadne - is still out there. Prove this deception, kindred. Find the knowledge stones, go through the portal network. Find the truth...}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_23	{The structure sings with exotic energies. It sees me. It knows my mind.
In the song I hear names, distant, faded... I hear the number at the end of all things.
I see its whisperer. I see a nameless form banish Ariadne...
And I see a duplicate arising from the crash, returning to claim its shape.
If this vision is to be believed, then Hesperus is right. Ariadne is an imposter.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_DESC_23A	{This place wishes to help me... if I can just provide it with resources.}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_BLD_RES_23	{The exotic energy dissipates, but its song lingers.
What has become of Ariadne? Who is the imposter standing in their place?}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_RIFT_OPT_A	{Offer materials}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_COMP_OSD	{Anomalous Rift Stabilised}
UI_MP_PORTALQUEST_WATER_RES	{Something bubbles forth from the crash - a scrap of nano-fibre material, not unlike my own exosuit. A grim relic of the last explorer to reach this site?
Embedded in the fabric is an oxygen upgrade, still intact. I take it with me. Perhaps it can assist my underwater search.}

A voice within them screams of boundary failure, of corruption, but it is not my voice.

They smile for the last time.}

It took years to establish communication. There are rules for everything - protocols that must be followed. But if you understand causality, you can do anything.

They understood at last. They had never been alone. “Speak,” they whispered. “Speak...”}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_EXTRA_3	{They explored. They survived where others did not. They did what they had to do.

'Why did you laugh?' the Traveller asked. 'I made you. I made everything...'}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_EXTRA_7	{That night, the ATLAS showed it the multiverse.

They saw a world of billions, where bipeds slept their lives away, happy, sad, angry, alone. There was nothing in the stars, nothing to yearn for, nothing to find. And as if waking from a dream, their Traveller changed everything. 16, they sang. 16...

They saw others. A place of peace, where the Traveller went from world to world in bliss, life learning about life.

They saw a realm of wonders, a fallen empire. They saw Balaron, Korvax-Prime. They saw a hundred worlds that were and could have been, and the journeys of Travellers through them all. They saw happiness.}

Nada looks at me with concern.}

NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG2	{Nada-Friend guides lost anomalies to our home, makes them safe from the Crimson Hunter! Nada is great friend indeed.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_2	{Ask about Artemis}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_2	{Perhaps Artemis-Friend has forgotten us. That would be sad. Or! I will think that Artemis-Friend has travelled<DELAY>0.3<> somewhere when they have not met us yet.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT2	{We will see Artemis-Friend again sometime, do not fret. There is a time where we are all friends.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG3	{Boundaries are strange things, Traveller-Friend. Most things stay where they belong. Other things - our home, Atlas, and now Artemis-Friend - slip between. Curious!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_3	{Ask about Portals}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_3	{Just devices, Traveller-Friend. To be understood, copied, advanced! That is all we can do with this universe, yes? Appreciate it!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT3	{Might we all fall somewhere strange, like Artemis-Friend? Maybe we already have...}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG4	{Nada is alarmed by Apollo-Friend. I am not. It is exciting to see where our model fails! If we are wrong, then there are more friends than we realised, more friends and more stars!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_4	{Ask about Sentinels}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_4	{Novel Apollo allies himself with the Vy'keen, enjoys to hunt the Sentinels! Good!<DELAY>0.5<> But it will not work.
They will always come. It is beyond us to change. Everywhere our home as been, the hunters will follow.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT4	{Talk, read! Study monoliths, if you can find them! Give yourself a strong brain to match those strong legs! To explore is to discover yourself, friend!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG5	{How are you? Are you hungry? This is customary greeting for old friend, yes?
I told Nada you would be fine, Traveller-Friend! Poor Nada. They do get nervous.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_5	{Ask about strange worlds}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_5	{Once, such places did not exist, could not be seen. But now? Every second more appear. They seep through, a new creation!
I do not know where these new worlds come from, what lies beyond our boundaries. I do not think I will ever know. But they are exciting to see, yes?}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT5	{You are safe here, Traveller-Friend. Do not worry! Our little home seals off the glitches that might harm us.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG6	{Nada says you have met missing-Friend. Missing-Friend did not like me.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_6	{Ask about -null-}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_6	{They are not like me or like Nada. They have freedom. Like all of you Traveller-friends. But they do not share the sights they see. They hoard them. They are jealous. Polo does not approve.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT6	{You are not like me, friend! You can still go to planets. You can still meet new lifeforms, speak, shout, love!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG7	{Nada-Friend does not trust the portals. Scared of rampancy, of the Crimson Hunter. But I do not fear in the same way.
What might we discover, Traveller-Friend? What might we learn from them? They have the same roots as you, as our home, as all this universe.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_7	{Ask about fear}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_7	{Nada is scared we may lose our home. I am scared I will forget the world outside it.<DELAY>0.4<> Do not let us forget, Traveller-Friend.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT7	{Do promise to be careful, Traveller-Friend. Portals are exciting, discovery is exciting... but come back to us. Do try to always come back to us.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG8	{I miss the dirt, friend, the worlds on which I once walked... I miss the sounds of birds and beasts. Even my data, even my recordings are gone, as if they had never been...}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_8	{Ask about Artemis}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_8	{Nada told me about your choice. You are wise. There is no easy action for poor Artemis-Friend.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT8	{All data decays. But our home will give us longer than most. Things to be grateful for!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG10	{Missing-Friend has you do their business. Help if you must, but always discover for yourself! Think about what you do, do not just follow instructions with your eyes not open!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_10	{Ask about the Vy'keen}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_10	{Big grumpy fellows! They do not like friendly little Gek.<DELAY>0.6<>. Perhaps they are wise. Like all beings, you will see their value if you get to know them.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT10	{Fight only to survive, friend. Treasure the galaxy and all its wonder! You will go far, I am sure of it!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG11	{Gek are always competitive, always squabble. It is not personal. My person is not rejected.<DELAY>0.4<> But Nada... poor Nada suffers.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_11	{Ask about the Korvax}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_11	{Their kind expect harmony, unity. Nada sees in a way they do not see, and so they reject poor Nada.
Convergence was bought at a great cost. They will fight to maintain it. Anomalies are cast aside, the necessary sacrifice.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT11	{I think Atlas-Being is a convergence of sorts. This is why the Korvax fear it.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG12	{Do you learn about all our origins, Traveller-Friend? Great mysteries, deep patterns, Gek, Korvax, Vy'keen, Sentinel... All are rooted somewhere.<DELAY>0.4<> Have you clues to your own beginnings? The strangest puzzle!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_12	{Ask about other Gek}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_12	{We are <DELAY>0.3<>all<DELAY>0.2<> a funny sort, Traveller-Friend. Some are angry, some are greedy, some are dear friends. I will wait my whole life to see what I am.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT12	{Nada-Friend was enough for me for many years. Now I have so many friends! They are my new spawn-family.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG13	{I have always wanted to know more. To discover is joy! But now I wonder... perhaps some things I should not discover. Nada may be right.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_13	{Ask about anomalies}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_13	{We are all anomalies here. We should not exist. And yet, we do. Joy!
But something is different. Were we always this many? No? I cannot remember. Is more anomalies good?
More friends - good! More to discover - good! More thinking - good! It seems so. But still I wonder...}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT13	{The stars are hardened, friend. We must find out why.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG14	{Will I know, Traveller-Friend, when it happens?
I suppose it may have happened before, already, again and again. Do you know if it has? I suppose you must not.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT14	{Always be kind, Traveller-Friend. Always discover. I will miss you.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_HELP_RES_14	{Of course. But do not delay on our account, friend. Do what you must. It will just be another discovery!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG15	{You have spoken to Nada? Joy! New arrivals, new friends!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_OPT_15	{Tell Polo the truth}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_RES_15	{Do not speak, friend. Nada tells me. It is first, it is last, so it goes. Some things I do not want to discover.}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_WAIT15	{Always more to do, oh yes, but not just now, friend. Go, be free, see the stars!}
NPC_POLO_NEXUSCORE_LANG16	{Go further, go faster, see it all! Have no regrets, friend! I am proud of you!}

FTH_EXOTIC3_LANG_1	{Have you stood before a portal, stranger? Felt it leech the life from your skin, felt your chest burning as its power starts to melt your very being?}

FTH_EXOTIC3_OPT_B_1	{Say you have not}
FTH_EXOTIC3_RES_A_1	{The Traveller narrows their eyes, staring at me, judging my claim.
After a moment, they nod. There is respect upon their face.}

FTH_EXOTIC4_OPT_A_5	{Say you have}
FTH_EXOTIC4_OPT_B_5	{Say you have not}
FTH_EXOTIC4_RES_A_5	{Then you know what it's like to be hunted by them.
Suffice to say the Sentinels and I had a conflict of interest. And now, it's in my interest to lay low here.}

TRA_NPC_DUST_RET_RES_A_3	{In the strangest of coincidences, the other Gek in the image is unquestionably familiar: I recognise the farmer I hired to attend my base. This must be their home planet.
%NAME% is beside themselves with joy as I share the coordinates for my base. They thank me over and over, babbling in their own language, and finishing up with a gift.}
TRA_NPC_DUST_RET_RES_B_3	{I shake my head apologetically. I cannot place this specific Gek, not with any certainty. %NAME%, nodding sadly, seems to have expected this response.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_DESC_2	{The Gek flinches as I approach, and hurriedly stows the datapad they were examining. I catch only a fleeting glimpse of a healthy-looking financial report, alongside what looks like plans for a nutrient distribution and irrigation system.
They indicate the toxic landscape outside, pointing out some of the more striking fungal clusters. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...}
DNT_TRA_NPC_TOX_LANG_2	{My friend has much admired farm, always they succeeds! Help distribute spores here, create rival business?}
TRA_NPC_TOX_OPT_A_2	{Offer botanical assistance}
TRA_NPC_TOX_OPT_B_2	{Leave}
TRA_NPC_TOX_RES_A_2	{The Gek seems taken aback by my offer of help, as though they had somehow expected less from me. They nod tentatively, again pointing out the fungal clusters.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_RES_B_2	{The Gek looks at me blankly, their expression unreadable.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_FARM_RET	{%NAME% jumps in surprise. It seems they hadn't expected to see me again.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_FARM_RET_OPT_A	{Give samples}
TRA_NPC_TOX_FARM_RET_RES_A	{The Gek takes the fungus, but their response is muted. They sniff at its gills suspiciously. They seem to be questioning its origins, perhaps thinking me some sort of threat, or spy.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_FARM_RET2_OPT_A	{Give units}
TRA_NPC_TOX_FARM_RET2_OPT_B	{Threaten them}
TRA_NPC_TOX_FARM_RET2_OPT_C	{Prove identity}
TRA_NPC_TOX_FARM_RET2_RES_A	{The trader shivers with involuntary pleasure as they receive the units. They still seem suspicious, but the monetary gift has soothed them somewhat.
Taking the mould in one hand, they process it in a small device. The contraption steams up, and the spores inflate into what look like miniature fungal trees. The bizarre spectacle is over in moments.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_FARM_RET2_RES_B	{%NAME%, already on edge, reacts poorly to being threatened. They shout at me furiously to get out of their sight.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_FARM_RET2_RES_C	{I produce my Exosuit's logs of my past dealings with other Geks. %NAME%, persuaded of my integrity, apologises profusely. They transfer me units as a gesture of goodwill.
Taking the mould in one hand, they process it in a small device. The contraption steams up, and the spores inflate into what look like miniature fungal trees. The bizarre spectacle is over in moments.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_DESC_3	{A musty odour surrounds this Gek, their scales glistening with anxious sweat. They seem glad of my company, but not entirely present in it, their eyes darting repeatedly towards a landing pad outside this facility.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_TOX_LANG_3	{Grand Festival events imminent! Collection is late, late, late! Trade Lords will not be happy!}
TRA_NPC_TOX_OPT_A_3	{Ask about landing pad}
TRA_NPC_TOX_OPT_B_3	{Ask about container}
TRA_NPC_TOX_RES_A_3	{The Gek gazes anxiously towards the landing pads, as though hoping to see a specific ship. They indicate the container they clutch, and gesture towards a date printed on its side.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_RES_B_3	{Surreptitiously, as though not authorised to do so, %NAME% cracks open the container they clutch. Inside, I glimpse a pale fungus, coated in fur. It looks freshly picked, and smells dizzying, almost like starship fuel.
The Gek licks their beak, then quickly re-seals the container. They gesture towards a date printed on its side, then again look towards the facility's landing pads.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_RET_3	{Fresh perspiration leaks from their face. Whoever was scheduled to collect this product from %NAME% is running very late.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_RET_OPT_A_3	{Offer to deliver product}
TRA_NPC_TOX_RET_OPT_B_3	{Request official help}
TRA_NPC_TOX_RET_RES_A_3	{%NAME%'s eyes widen as I reach for the container, shaking their head no. They acknowledge the sincerity of my offer, but cannot let this out of their sight.}
TRA_NPC_TOX_RET_RES_B_3	{Reaching out to the local authorities, I prompt %NAME% to explain their dilemma. There is a muffled <AUDIO>TXT_RadioNoise<>sound in the transmission, then a new voice comes on the line.
A Gek Trade Lord - speaking in language I can understand - personally thanks me. I am to be compensated for my assistance, and a different courier will be along shortly to deliver the container to the Grand Festival.}
TRA_NPC_RAD_DESC_2	{This Gek is examining an array of hydro-balanced specimen capsules, each crafted from a slightly different material, and containing a single blossom, oddly radiant.
The small lifeform beams at me, apparently proud to show off their botanical collection. They indicate the irradiated landscape outside. I gather that they are <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>...}
DNT_TRA_NPC_RAD_LANG_2	{I am loving life! Loving plants here, such excellence! Nothing to do with profits.}
TRA_NPC_RAD_OPT_A_2	{Offer botanical assistance}
TRA_NPC_RAD_OPT_B_2	{Leave}
TRA_NPC_RAD_RES_A_2	{The Gek clicks their beak in jittery excitement, pleased to have found a kindred soul with an interest in plants.}
TRA_NPC_RAD_RES_B_2	{The Gek raises one of the blossom capsules, as if to prove how beautiful it is. They look sad as I leave.}
TRA_NPC_RAD_FARM_RET_LANG	{No need for queries. The technology will be obedient.}
TRA_NPC_RAD_FARM_RET	{%NAME% terminates a call. They greet me sweetly, hoping I have brought the promised Gamma Weed cuttings.}
TRA_NPC_RAD_FARM_RET_OPT_A	{Give samples}
TRA_NPC_RAD_FARM_RET_RES_A	{%NAME% inserts the glowing weed into a handheld device, which begins to vibrate. Puffs of luminous pollen drift around the chamber. The Gek then hands me the extracted seeds, ready for planting.}
TRA_NPC_RAD_FARM_RET_OPT_B	{Ask about call}
TRA_NPC_RAD_FARM_RET_RES_B	{A look of concentration passes over the Gek's face, and I am hit with a cloying smell. It is distractingly unidentifiable - somewhere between burnt sugar and decomposition. I find I can't remember what I just asked.}
TRA_NPC_RAD_DESC_3	{Something about this Gek seems pioneering, bold. A light dusting of soil coats the ends of their sleeves, as though they've been rummaging in the earth outside.
They show me a chunk of irradiated mineral they have collected - not uranium, but a glowing crimson substance that I struggle to look at directly. They have fashioned some of the strange material into an experimental suit upgrade, apparently ready to sell...}
DNT_TRA_NPC_RAD_LANG_3	{Look at this geological find! Element shiny like stars, makes good suit technology for you, friend!}
TRA_NPC_RAD_OPT_A_3	{Trade units for upgrade}
TRA_NPC_RAD_OPT_B_3	{Trade gift for upgrade}
TRA_NPC_RAD_RES_A_3	{As I reach out to take the technology, I am suddenly overpowered by nausea. For a moment, everything hurts - every joint screams, my soft tissue on fire, the pressure behind my eyes unbearable...
The moment passes. The Gek looks at me, slightly puzzled, but is pleased to have made a sale.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_DESC_1	{This Gek is gripping a datapad, making notes in what appears to be a personalised database of product IDs and associated prices. Their fingers fly across the screen with a zealous, almost greedy enthusiasm.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_SHOP_LANG_1	{So much to buy! Best trade on planet! Economy here is fascinating, friend! I research, find best trade routes.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_A_1	{Examine data}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_B_1	{Deeply examine data}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_C_1	{Request commodity evaluation}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_A_1	{The Gek seems happy to share their research. They eagerly talk me through some of their favourite trade routes, and offer directions to a nearby outpost.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_B_1	{The Gek seems thrilled to share their research with a genuine friend. They eagerly talk me through some of their favourite trade routes, and offer directions to a nearby outpost, gifting me Units as a gesture of friendship.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_C_1	{The Gek rotates the curio in their hands, squeaking with approval as they assess its quality. They offer me a good price, and make note of the system where they can turn a profit on it.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_DESC_2	{This Gek has been observing me closely from the moment I stepped into this small trade outlet. They look completely at home, as though most of their time is spent here.
They share two images of Multi-Tools: the left one elaborate and extensively modified, accompanied by a large Unit sum; the right a simpler but far less expensive model. They look at me expectantly, awaiting a choice.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_SHOP_LANG_2	{Hello friend! Units to spend? Which product would friend choose?}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_A_2	{Choose left image}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_B_2	{Choose right image}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_C_2	{Choose both}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_A_2	{A delighted shriek erupts from the Gek, causing my ears to ring. A sunny aroma fills the small building, and the Gek transfers me a gift of Units. I itch to spend them immediately.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_B_2	{They seem unsurprised by my choice, and exchange both a meaningful look and an eye-stinging scent with the Gek behind the counter.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_C_2	{The Gek pauses, thrown by my choice. Evidently, they had not considered the possibility of this outcome. Eventually their beak opens into a smile, and offer me Units to encourage my urge to spend.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_DESC_3	{The Gek is lazily browsing the trade terminal catalogue, not appearing to be searching for anything in particular. They make a note of a few items that apparently catch their interest, uttering a soft exclamation to themselves.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_SHOP_LANG_3	{Best bargains on best items for best Gek friends! Merchant and I best friends since spawn.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_A_3	{Join in browsing}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_B_3	{Point to highlighted item}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_C_3	{Point to random item}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_A_3	{The Gek chuckles to themselves as I accompany their browsing the items available for trade. I somehow get the feeling that I am the subject of their private joke. They pat me gently and give me Units, as though in sympathy.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_B_3	{The Gek suddenly takes notice, looking me up and down. After a moment of assessment, they shake their head, indicating a different item instead. They are so pleased by the opportunity to share their knowledge that they purchase and gift me the item.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_C_3	{The Gek looks at me, looks at the item I have indicated, looks at me again - and then dissolves into helpless giggling. The merchant behind the counter shakes their head in a way that suggests they have seen this scenario before.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_DESC_4	{This Gek is entering copious notes into a datapad, looking around furtively. They seem to be assessing the quality of this trade facility, but when they notice me observing them, they straighten themselves awkwardly and shield the device's screen from view.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_SHOP_LANG_4	{Not for your eyes! I am just customer, not from rival trade station, nothing illegal!}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_A_4	{Peek at notes}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_B_4	{Point out a facility detail}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_OPT_C_4	{Alert merchant}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_A_4	{The Gek seems irritated, snatching their datapad away from my reach. They point at themselves and then at me, shaking their head and babbling until I leave.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_B_4	{I subtly draw %NAME%'s attention to a minor manufacturing fault in the facility's construction. They seem oddly comforted by the detail, adding it to their notes. They coyly slip me a gift in thanks.}
TRA_NPC_SHOP_RES_C_4	{I clear my throat loudly, drawing the nearby merchant's attention to %NAME%'s surreptitious note-taking. A gentle alarm sounds, and I am immediately rewarded by the Gek Trade Federation for aiding the fight against corporate espionage.}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_DESC_1	{The Gek, overwhelmed by excitement, begins to hyperventilate as I approach. They query something on their datapad, then look up at me.
Proudly, they extend a hand to shake mine, confident they have identified the socially appropriate greeting for my species.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_LANG_1	{A new friend! A traveller friend! I am here to make new friends. I must choose the correct hello...}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_OPT_A_1	{Shake their hand}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_OPT_B_1	{Embrace them}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_OPT_C_1	{Punch them}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RES_A_1	{A coo of delight escapes %NAME% as we shake hands. Their grip is surprisingly well calibrated, neither too firm nor too flimsy. It is a well-researched handshake, if unpracticed.}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RES_B_1	{%NAME% gasps, recognising this alternative form of greeting. There is an awkward clink of beak upon glass as they attempt to kiss my visor.}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RES_C_1	{%NAME% begins to cry, not understanding what error they made to provoke such an aggressive response. They no longer seem to want to be friends.}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_1	{The Gek gestures around the outpost, indicating all the friends they have acquired here. They then gesture towards me, smiling shyly. I am now counted among %NAME%'s many friends, and they would like to know the size of my own friendship circle.}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_OPT_A_1	{A modest circle}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_OPT_B_1	{A wide circle}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_OPT_C_1	{An enviable circle}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_RES_A_1	{The Gek's expression flickers, something else briefly replacing their excitement. Out of their depth, they regress to the social niceties most familiar to them, and gift me units to assist with my future friendships.}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_RES_B_1	{The Gek looks awed to be in the company of such a prominent diplomat. %NAME% slips something into my hand, hoping I will remember them.}
TRA_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_RES_C_1	{%NAME% is hyperventilating again.
Instinctively, they shower me with units, hoping to impress.}
TRA_NPC_OBS_DESC_1	{This Gek seems startled, their breathing rapid and shallow. Apparently, they were not expecting company.}
DNT_TRA_NPC_OBS_LANG_1	{Friend surprised me! This is legal business network! But technology does need help...}
TRA_NPC_OBS_DESC_1A	{%NAME%'s sharp eyes dart over my pack, considering its possible contents. They cautiously point towards the facility's terminal, perhaps requesting help...}
TRA_NPC_OBS_OPT_A_1	{Offer assistance}
TRA_NPC_OBS_RES_A_1	{The Gek nods warily, their guard still up.}
TRA_NPC_OBS_RES_B_1	{The Gek says nothing, keeping their thoughts to themselves.}
TRA_NPC_OBS_WAIT_1	{The Gek gives a sceptical click of their beak. The facility terminal remains non-functional, at least for whatever %NAME%'s purposes are.}
TRA_TERM_OBS_DESC_1	{The facility dish is sweeping for some ancient signal, the terminal tarnished with age and disuse. However, the dust is smeared in places, where modern components have been wired into the original equipment.
Whatever this terminal was repurposed for, it is currently malfunctioning. The modern tech has been inexpertly installed, and the central wiring loom seems to have short circuited.}
TRA_TERM_OBS_OPT_A_1	{Replace loom}
TRA_TERM_OBS_CHAIN_DESC_1	{The display immediately brightens, rendering a celestial map of several nearby systems. Dozens of starship beacons, red and green, blink erratically around the map.
Periodically, the green beacons swarm together, encircling a target. The surrounded beacon fades to nothing, apparently destroyed. At the bottom of the screen, a <IMG>UNITS<> value increases dramatically.}

TRA_TERM_OBS_CHAIN_RES_B_1	{I select the option to 'extract profits' from the terminal. My account immediately begins to flood with units, thousands upon thousands.
The nearby Gek suddenly notices what I am doing. They shut the process down, screaming at me to get out.}
TRA_NPC_OBS_RET_DESC_1	{The Gek looks pleased to see their network connection restored, though there is still a skittishness about them. They offer me a reasonable sum of units for the supplies and labour I have provided.}
TRA_NPC_OBS_RET_OPT_A_1	{Accept payment}
TRA_NPC_OBS_RET_OPT_B_1	{Threaten with data}
TRA_NPC_OBS_RET_RES_A_1	{%NAME% seems to relax at last. They transfer the promised payment with a sly smile.}

TRA_NPC_OBS_RET2_RES_A_1	{The Gek transfers the bribe with a forced smile, then pointedly motions for me to leave.}
TRA_NPC_OBS_RET2_RES_B_1	{I report the illegal pirate network to the Gek Trade Federation. %NAME% wails with despair, cursing themselves for involving me. The authorities, however, are thrilled, and transfer a generous reward.}
TRA_NPC_FREIGHTER_DESC_1	{This Gek seems relatively new to freighter life. From time to time their eyes drift towards the windows, seemingly mesmerised by the infinite expanse of stars and the distant worlds orbiting them.}
TRA_NPC_FREIGHTER_DESC_2	{The Gek stares at me with open fascination. Something about their wide-eyed curiosity seems naive, as though they've lived a sheltered existence. Perhaps they have never stepped outside this very freighter.}
TRA_NPC_FREIGHTER_DESC_3	{The gloves of this Gek's Exosuit bear traces of food, and the fingers are slightly puckered, suggesting a long history of damage and repair. I gather they must be responsible for feeding the freighter's crew.}
TRA_NPC_FREIGHTER_DESC_4	{This Gek seems content enough to serve on this freighter, but I notice them checking their account balance with a frequency bordering on obsessive. Perhaps they see a different life in their future.}
TRA_NPC_FREIGHTER_DESC_5	{The lifeform stands to attention as I near them, stashing away some products they've readied for trade. Freighter life must be a lucrative opportunity for enterprising Geks.}

WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_DESC_2	{The starship is only lightly damaged, its navigation still actively targeting coordinates in a nearby system. Judging by the movement of the target, it is almost certainly another ship, perhaps only one hyperdrive jump away.
A cursory examination reveals that both the launch thrusters and hyperdrive have been drained of fuel. It seems a simple empty tank is the source of all the warrior's frustration.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_OPT_A_2	{Fuel launch thruster}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_RES_A_2	{The launch thruster is refueled. The ship is no longer grounded, and any further maintenance can be carried out at a space station or trade outpost.}

WAR_CRASHSITE_OPT_A_3	{Ask about Gek}
WAR_CRASHSITE_OPT_B_3	{Listen}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RES_A_3	{%NAME% turns fiercely. They seem to rage at me, the Gek, themselves, and the nearby ruined ship all at once. The Gek on the communicator defends themselves shrilly, adding to the cacophony.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RES_B_3	{The two lifeforms shout over each other, neither pausing to listen. The Vy'keen's tone is accusatory, the Gek's defensive. Several times, %NAME% rattles the datapad and points to the nearby ruined ship.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RET_DESC_3	{The details of the argument are unclear, but the Vy'keen's starship is certainly involved. Investigating it directly may be more productive than engaging with this bickering.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_DESC_3	{The ship's components are much newer than its hull. Someone has done a reasonable refurbishment job, but one safety gyro was installed cheaply, and has rattled loose. The Vy'keen was lucky to walk away unscathed.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_OPT_A_3	{Reinstall gyroscope}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_RES_A_3	{I refit the gyroscope with a more appropriate adhesive. With the stabilisation features restored, the ship is safe to fly again.}

<MOOD>VeryPositive<>%NAME% suddenly seems amused by the situation. They let loose a chuckle, and share some of their cargo with me in thanks.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RET2_OPT_B_3	{Just tell them it's fixed}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RET2_RES_B_3	{I shrug off the question, implying that the problem is resolved, and not worth dwelling on. The SalesGek's relief is tangible.
%NAME% pays me for my assistance, seeming calmer. A moment later, more units hit my account from an anonymous source.}

WAR_CRASHSITE_RES_A_4	{The Vy'keen shares some footage. I recognise %NAME% themselves in the video, but with none of their present serenity. They stand atop a shattered sentinel walker, laughing maniacally, firing their Multi-Tool into the air.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RES_B_4	{%NAME% turns to face their ship, and sighs. Their journey has been halted by an equipment failure - and they are a warrior, not a mechanic. They offer cargo in exchange for any help...}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_DESC_4	{This unglamorous vessel has been worn down by decades of daily use. The ship looks cared for - the weapons, especially, have been well-maintained - but some parts appear to have corroded over time.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_OPT_A_4	{Remove corrosion}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_RES_A_4	{Fortunately, the rust is only superficial, and has not eaten far into the components. I carefully lift the corrosion from the affected parts, restoring functionality to several connectors.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_OPT_B_4	{Replace part}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_RES_B_4	{I replace the corroded parts with fresh metal sheeting, ensuring there will be no need to revisit them for some time.}

WAR_CRASHSITE_DESC_5	{The warrior greets me with a rough immediacy, yanking my hand forward to shake it. They seem pleased to have company, and very willing to share some of the valuables they carry - in return for help with their broken ship.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_OPT_A_5	{Offer assistance}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RES_A_5	{%NAME% barks with laughter. They are very glad to have encountered me.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_DESC_5	{The ship is Vy'keen military issue, though the insignia is so plastered with grime that the regiment is impossible to identify. The hull bears the scars of dozens - possibly hundreds - of dogfights. Plasma fire has completely sliced through part of the wing.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_OPT_A_5	{Repair hull}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_RES_A_5	{The damage to the wing is extensive, but not irreparable. Once repaired, the patched-up section barely stands out from the rest of the ship's wear and tear.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_OPT_B_5	{Examine cargo}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_RES_B_5	{Stealthily, I peer into the cargo hold. Crates of valuables are stacked high - all legally-tradable goods, with the exception of one small box, stashed conspicuously under a sheet. It seems unlikely that these substances were legitimately acquired.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RET_DESC_5	{%NAME% greets me warmly, impressed by my repair job. They lazily proffer the promised reward. It looks rare, and valuable.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RET_OPT_A_5	{Accept reward}

WAR_CRASHSITE_RET_OPT_B_5	{Report crime}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RET_RES_B_5	{I radio my coordinates to the system authorities. A bounty payout is transferred immediately to my accounts - it seems they have been hunting this notorious pirate for months.

WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_OPT_B_6	{Shoot through a crack}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_RES_B_6	{Opening the cockpit just a crack, I quickly fire my Multi-Tool just once, then slam the door shut. Something inside hisses angrily. The whispering seems faster now.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_RET_OPT_A_6	{Shoot again}
WAR_CRASHSITE_SHIP_RET_RES_A_6	{This time, the shot seems to find its mark. There is a single gurgling scream, and a green liquid splatters the cockpit window and my Multi-Tool. Silence follows.}
WAR_CRASHSITE_RET_DESC_6	{%NAME% is writhing slightly, as though uncomfortable in their Exosuit. They say nothing, but the question in their eyes is clear.}

WAR_CRASHSITE_DESC_7	{The Vy'keen warrior holds themselves with a practised dignity. They sneer slightly as I approach, with the impatience of a high-ranking officer unused to being kept waiting. They gesture languidly towards their ship.}

WAR_NPC_DUST_FARM_RET_RES_A	{The Vy'keen grasps the spiny flora with a gloved hand, driving a wedge of its flesh into a specialised device. They hand me the seeds that pop loose, along with a small cup of pressed juice, carefully setting the rest aside. }
WAR_NPC_DUST_FARM_RET2_OPT_A	{Try the juice}
WAR_NPC_DUST_FARM_RET2_OPT_B	{Refuse it}
WAR_NPC_DUST_FARM_RET2_RES_A	{I nervously sip from the cup, feeling %NAME%'s beady gaze on me. The juice is surprisingly sweet, but I don't notice any immediate effect. Perhaps it only affects Vy'keen physiology.}
WAR_NPC_DUST_FARM_RET2_RES_B	{%NAME% shrugs and quaffs the juice themselves. Their eyes acquire an intense, shimmering quality, and the cup suddenly shatters<PROP>None<> in their hand. I leave before this situation gets any stranger.}

WAR_NPC_TOX_RES_A_3	{With great pride, %NAME% shows me footage of their clan in battle. Striking at night, each Vy'keen warrior has blackened their Multi-Tool, suit, and skin with coagulated paint.
The contrast between the advanced, high-tech equipment and simple warpaint creates a surreal and terrifying display.}
WAR_NPC_TOX_RES_B_3	{The mixture is primarily a highly toxic strain of toadstool, bound into a paste with dark Vy'keen blood. Ritualistically prepared, it is unclear whether its purpose is purely cosmetic, or whether the toxicity has some other effect.}

WAR_NPC_TOX_RET_RES_B_3	{%NAME% chuckles, impressed with my boldness, and daubs a little of the paste onto my bare hand. It tingles, burning cold - a sensation that soon spreads up my wrist, my arm, my shoulder.
The world tilts, and I have a sudden vision of myself speeding into battle, the muscles of a huge mount rippling beneath me. My sibling-warriors and I charge into the night, twin moons above. Bolts of glowing plasma pierce the darkness, extinguishing the crimson eyes that float around us.
The vision fades. My hand aches. %NAME%, watching my face, nods knowingly, and provides a large gift to assist my future battles.}
WAR_NPC_TOX_RET_RES_C_3	{As delicately as I can, I decline %NAME%'s offer, trying to convey that I am no Vy'keen warrior.
Seeming to understand my meaning, they are impressed with my respect for their people. They dismiss me with an approving grunt, their estimation of me re-evaluated.}
WAR_NPC_RAD_DESC_2	{The Vy'keen meets my eyes with a steely gaze and rigid posture. They tap at the military orders in their hand: they have been transferred to this planet to secure an ongoing source of Gamma Weed. The warrior honours me by <STELLAR>asking for my assistance<>.}

WAR_NPC_RAD_RES_A_3	{I stretch towards the space %NAME% is watching so warily. Unsurprisingly, my hand passes through thin air.
In a panic, as though to protect me, they grab my wrist and pull it down. Whatever they believe they see, they are convinced of its danger.}
WAR_NPC_RAD_RES_B_3	{I unholster my Multi-Tool and attempt to aim directly at the spot %NAME% is watching. They seem relieved to see the invisible threat addressed - then reel backwards, blinking rapidly.}
WAR_NPC_RAD_RES_C_3	{I shake %NAME% by the shoulders, trying to rattle the delusion from them.
There is a resounding smack as the Vy'keen's fist collides with my chest. This disorientation doesn't seem to have dulled their aggression, or their strength.}
WAR_NPC_RAD_RET_3	{The Vy'keen looks increasingly ill. A fresh wave of nausea threatens to overtake them, but their suit intervenes, allowing them to regain some composure.
Their overloaded hazard protection flashes a desperate red. The local radiation has extended it to the verge of failure. %NAME% will not last much longer in this state.}

%NAME%'s breathing slows as the pain recedes. They remember themselves. Evidently, I have just saved a very wealthy warrior from certain death. They reward me generously, assuring me this will not be forgotten.}
WAR_NPC_RAD_RET_RES_B_3	{Recognising this as an emergency, I contact Vy'keen High Command, reporting %NAME%'s state to their battalion leader.
There is muttering and grunting on the transmission as the Vy'keen authorities confer. Finally, they thank me with a substantial payment, but urge me to avoid further contact with %NAME%.}
WAR_NPC_RAD_RET_RES_C_3	{I attempt to shout some sense into %NAME%, but it is no use. They rage feebly, mumbling something about sentinels, and urge me to take my shouting elsewhere.}
WAR_NPC_SHOP_DESC_1	{The Vy'keen is lazily crushing the bones of some unfortunate ex-creature between their fingertips, watching the dust spill to the floor. They look bored.}

WAR_NPC_SHOP_DESC_2	{Ostensibly, this Vy'keen is examining the facility's wares, but they seem to browse without purpose, fiddling with this and that.
They occasionally glance towards the sales counter, seeming to compare the merchant's brawn to their own. The glances cease when I approach.}

The merchant, who already seems dissatisfied with their rank, slouches behind the counter, seething. It seems clear that their day has been made just a little bit worse.}
WAR_NPC_SHOP_RES_B_2	{%NAME% is disconcerted when I draw attention to their upgraded, well-maintained, obviously recently purchased Multi-Tool. Even a race of warriors has need of merchants, it would appear.

WAR_NPC_SHOP_RES_C_2	{%NAME% glares, seemingly resentful of an accusation I did not make.}
WAR_NPC_SHOP_DESC_3	{The Vy'keen is pretending to read, but it is a weak attempt at subtlety: they are peering over the top of their datapad, examining my equipment upgrades.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_SHOP_LANG_3	{Vy'keen strength comes from Multi-Tool tradition! Trade important for weapon strength! Brother is foolish.}
WAR_NPC_SHOP_DESC_3A	{Abandoning the pretence, they address me directly, sharing two images of Vy'keen warriors. One is armed with an advanced Multi-Tool; the other with a simple dagger. They watch to see which impresses me more.}

WAR_NPC_SHOP_RET_RES_B_3	{The Vy'keen snorts, unimpressed. They have no interest in wasting weapon slots on data-gathering attachments. They wave me away.}
WAR_NPC_OUTPOST_DESC_1	{Though it doesn't show in their complexion or posture, this is a very old Vy'keen. Wisdom accrued from a lifetime of interstellar warfare burns bright in their eyes.
The elder seems disapproving of the crowd here, glaring uneasily at the other Vy'keens. Whatever society they were once accustomed to, this motley gathering of warriors does not reflect it.}
DNT_WAR_NPC_OUTPOST_LANG_1	{Pathetic warriors here. This is not Vy'keen tradition, this is tragedy. We have been conquered by machines. It must end.}
WAR_NPC_OUTPOST_OPT_A_1	{Sympathise}

WAR_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_RES_A_1	{The Vy'keen chuckles, as though the sight of the morbid compound evokes some sentimental memory for them. They pop a handful of crystals into their mouth and begin to chew.
The resultant crunching - like shattering molars - is enough to send a shudder down my spine, but the diversion pleases the elderly Vy'keen. Apparently moved by my kindness, they offer a small gift in return.}
WAR_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_RES_B_1	{%NAME% looks positively horrified, backing away the unwanted contact. Their opinion of the ramshackle crowd around us seems to suddenly improve, by contrast.}
WAR_NPC_OUTPOST_RET_RES_C_1	{%NAME% pats their weapon, looking misty-eyed. We lack the common tongue for complex dialogue, but - happy to share - they deliver their story via a methodical sequence of grunts, gestures and holograms. It is slow, but surprisingly engaging.
They describe what must be centuries of war against the Sentinels. Countless comrades have fallen, but while each unique Vy'keen life is irreplaceable, the machines seem infinite. Unaffected by individual losses.
Now in their twilight years, %NAME% is seizing their final chance to find and destroy the source of the Sentinel force. They are only machines, and must be assembled somewhere. They must be.
The elderly Vy'keen sighs. Their gruffness softens as they re-evaluate the Vy'keen crowd around us, each life precious. They thank me for listening, and give me something to further my own journey.}

WAR_NPC_OBS_RES_C_1	{The Vy'keen seems offended by the irreverence of my choice. They growl and shove me away.}
WAR_NPC_OBS_DESC_2	{The Vy'keen silences me with a raised hand as I approach, as though listening to a sound - but I hear nothing. They input something into a terminal, and an eerie static drone begins to sound from within my Exosuit. We lock eyes, listening together.
This facility seems to have been designed - or repurposed - to trace this specific audio signal. It hisses and pops, not quite coming through clearly.}

WAR_NPC_OBS_RES_B_2	{Compelled by a strange intuition, I calibrate the device's input to tune into the lower frequencies, filtering out the high-pitched crackles.
The unmistakable echo of a warrior's roar echoes through me, clear as glass. The Vy'keen looks at me with pure wonder, listening on their own equipment. I sense that this is something utterly unique we are sharing. They salute me as I leave, and offer a reverent gift.}
WAR_NPC_OBS_RES_C_2	{I attempt to recalibrate the direction of the audio receiver, but each adjustment I make only seems to weaken the signal. The Vy'keen shouts at me in frustration, indicating that I should leave.}
WAR_NPC_FREIGHTER_DESC_1	{The Vy'keen crewmember looks me over with thinly-veiled contempt. They sense that I am not a born freighter dweller like themselves, and are suspicious of my soft planetary background.}
