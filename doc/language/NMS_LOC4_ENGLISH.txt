UPDATE4_TITLE	{No Man's Sky NEXT Update}
UPDATE4_NOTES	{No Man's Sky NEXT brings a vast array of new features. For full details please see www.nomanssky.com.

* Multiplayer: Team up a small team of friends and explore the universe together.
* Visual Overhaul: The game is fully playable in third or first person, both on-foot and in ship.
* Command Freighters: Assemble and upgrade a fleet of frigates and command them from the bridge of your freighter.
* Unlimited Base Building: Bases can now be built anywhere on any planet.

The universe has been regenerated to make room for the various changes and features being added. As a result, planetary biomes, terrain and lifeforms have been changed, and your location may also be slightly adjusted. Bases have been temporarily archived but can be restored at any base computer.

Hello Games has been hard at work to improve and expand No Man’s Sky. We hope you enjoy :)
Thank you so much,
Hello Games}

NPC_WATERPLAQUE_TITLE	{The Voice of the Shell}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_DESC	{I hear a voice, soft but insistent, growing ever louder as I linger before the ancient altar. It flows closer, the water rushing about me, demanding that I listen to its tale.}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_OPT	{Accept the waves}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_RES	{I pull back and the roar of the oceans subsides. As the light of the ruin fades, I find an ancient key, perfect despite its age.}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_1	{I went down to the beach today. There's something about the sea at this time of year. It draws you in, distorts your sense of time. Salty frost on stubby grass, the sand blowing off the tops of the dunes. No-one else for miles.
People love the sound of waves, but it takes grey skies and high winds to really feel it, to understand their never-ending crash, the drum they beat upon the land. It makes me shiver.}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_2	{I went back to the shore this morning, just for a walk to clear my head. I trod the dunes as usual, my heater turned up in contrast to the freezing winds. But then I saw it.
A clear glass sphere, picked out by the glint of the rising sun. Utterly perfect, no colour to taint it, no chips to spoil its perfect geometry.
I took it, of course. I've marvelled at it all day, watching how the light changes as it passes through, filtered and pure.}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_3	{The shore walks have become a habit now, a daily ritual. I've walked for miles, treading the sand, crunching shells beneath my feet, searching for another pebble like that first.
I've gotten faster, more efficient. I don't need the sun any more. My torch does just as well, sweeping the rocks, searching for that flicker of light, some hope of reflected perfection.
The only thing that stops me now is the tide, and I almost didn't notice that last night. The salty water around my ankles brought me round.}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_4	{The suit complains, but I found a way to bypass the salinity alarms. I never need to stop now, whatever mood the tide takes. The water level has risen this year, and without these modifications I'd have lost my old shore paths long ago.
I miss the dunes, but needs must. I can't afford to retreat inland like the others, and besides - the glass looks just as pure and brilliant in the water as it does the air.}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_5	{I've surveyed uncountable millions, but there's nothing. All the other rocks look so drab and dull, so lifeless, so damaged. No matter how deep I go, there's never anything to match it.
I see whole worlds, stars, reflected in its brilliance. I know there must be more out there.}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_6	{It's gone. 
I took it out this morning and I saw it, faint but unmistakable. A crack, no more than a hair, but enough. Its light no longer pure, but tainted with a crimson diffusion.
I couldn't bear to look at it. After all I've done for it, it lets me down like this? Get out! <STELLAR>Broken<>, <FUEL>awful<>, <SPECIAL>stupid -<>}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_7	{I found it. It took me days, but I found it. The worst days since I left the surface. I missed it so much.
The fault was all mine. When I found it, it was still as perfect as the day I found it. But my eyes... something is changing.
I'm so glad it's back.}
NPC_WATERPLAQUE_8	{I took my glove off this morning, to better grasp my pebble. The time down here has changed me. How long has it been? I've lost track...the green gave way to blue so long ago.
My hands are clear, pure. The light shines through me. Like glass. I -}

UI_WATERMISSION_STORY2	{LOG: <STELLAR>0115C<>. Breach Event <STELLAR>+21 Sols<>
The secondary dive team came back early today. They found a cave full of strange crystals, but the lights on the sub cut out and forced them home.
They seem upset, disturbed. But we have to go back while we still have an idea of where it is, before the shifting tides rob us. We'll never build anything without advanced materials.

UI_WATERMISSION_STORY4	{LOG: <STELLAR>0328A<>. Breach Event <STELLAR>+98 Sols<>
I had the dream again.
The endless purple waves, mile after mile after mile. A relief at first from that dull crimson ache. But then... I can't escape the feeling there's something else there. I look around, and there's nothing. Nothing.
I blink, and I see them. Faint at first, just lines. But it's unmistakable. Repeated geometric shapes, traced in the sky. Row after row of triangles, slowly scrolling past. And I can't explain it, but it's the most terrible thing I've ever seen.
It's almost a relief to wake up and see the rain again.}
UI_WATERMISSION_STORY5	{LOG: <STELLAR>1998B<>. Breach Event <STELLAR>+399 Sols<>
They've gone back to that wretched cave. Every one of them. No-one is listening to me. We can still build the hyperdrive, I know it. After that, flushing the salt out the launch thrusters will be easy.}
UI_WATERMISSION_STORY5A	{LOG: <STELLAR>2001P<>. Breach Event <STELLAR>+399 Sols<>
We've all had the same dream, the same rambling, the teeth in the sky, those crystals... It's nonsense. There's nothing else down there. We've taken it all.

NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_LANG6	{Polo's strange device has led me to another wreck. I stand before the shattered remains of its bridge computer, feeling as if this strange journey is nearly at an end.}

NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_OPT	{View recording}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_1	{I see the stranger carve the glyphs into the portal's stone. They step across the threshold, and the blue glow of the portal flashes a deep crimson. A terrifying, otherworldly scream resonates across the entire portal structure. The gateway closes soon after, its connection severed, any way back closed forever.
The recording ends soon after.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_2	{I see the stranger turn their back on the portal and return to their trudge across the lonely landscape. Their crewmates fall one by one, until the stranger walks alone.
The pace of the recording accelerates and the static buildup strengthens. I spool through hours of tape, but the stranger continues to wander, living off the land, never returning to their ship.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_3	{I see the stranger turn their back on the portal. They are alone, their crew consumed by whatever strange being they met at the abandoned building. Leaving the portal seems to have freed them from whatever strange spell had been haunting their sleep. They stumble, then look around, frantic.
The recording shows them retracing their steps, always alone, until they reach the crash site. They build a shelter, keeping vigil for their fallen friends.
Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I scan the wreck, but see nothing. As I turn back to the terminal, I see the recording has ended.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_4	{The stranger carves a series of glyphs into the portal, then steps across the threshold.
The recording warps slightly, but continues. I see the stranger standing on a hexagonal world, dwarfed by the wreck of a large starship. Their starship? They help a figure to their feet, a Korvax. With a jolt, I recognise Nada.
The Priest Entity seems to stare right at me, aware that I have seen this reunion. They nod, and the recording ends.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_5	{I see the stranger hesitate, then turn their back on the portal gateway. They look over their shoulder as they walk away, as if they heard a voice from across the threshold. As the recording continues, I see them return to the abandoned building where they met the traveller who promised them aid.
They search the building, attending frequently to the control terminal, growing ever more distraught. Their saviour never appears, the being with the glowing mask never returns. The stranger cries, alone. They go to sleep on the floor of the building. The recording ends.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_6	{The stranger carves a series of glyphs into the portal. They pause, as if called by a familiar voice. Seeing no-one, they continue across the threshold. A burst of static cuts the recording.
When the image returns, I see the stranger on the bridge of their freighter, surrounded by their crew. A Korvax priest entity joins them. With a shock, I recognise Nada. 
Within moments, chaos has erupted on the freighter. Sentinel fighters swarm the ship, their assault sending it into freefall. Another burst of static cuts across the recording. The final image is a single frame of a Gek specialist attending their radar station.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_7	{I see the stranger turn away from the portal, a sad shake of their head. But there seems to have been a mutiny. Their surviving crewmates ignore their pleas and enter the portal, unheeding. They are consumed by the foam, and the portal closes with a crimson flash.
The stranger walks a short distance, shaken. They assemble a small shelter, enter and close the door. The recording does not show them emerge.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_8	{The strangers carves their glyphs into the portal's stone. They stride towards the threshold, confident, as if called forward by a familiar voice. They enter, and a brilliant flash of white distorts the recording.
When the image settles, the portal is nowhere to be seen. All I see are stars, an endless parade of systems. The recording settles on a star and closes in rapidly. The same flash of light, and a new world blinks into existence.
The recording ends. What have I just witnessed?}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_9	{I see the stranger tap the control panel of the portal, their hands guided by an unseen force. The gateway opens, its blue light spilling out onto the surrounding landscape.
In this light, the stranger addresses their remaining crew. They try to persuade them to follow into the portal, but with no success. One by one, the crew walk away. Only the stranger remains.
Finally, they begin their approach. The foam consumes them, then dies down. The portal quietly closes. The recording shows nothing more.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_10	{I see the stranger examine the open portal, then step away. The recording shows the rest of their movements. They continue to travel, mile after mile, always at night. Each light source is found, examined, discarded.
They search each abandoned building they find, looking for the traveller who promised them salvation. The tapes seem to loop forever. I spool forwards through hour after hour of material, the pattern never varying, the stranger never seeming to age.
I search and search, but find no end to this story.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_11	{I see the stranger activate the portal and walk towards the open gateway. They hesitate as they reach the threshold, turning back to their crewmates for encouragement. They step forward, and are consumed by the foam.
A burst of static interrupts the recording. When it ends, I see the stranger surrounded once more by their crew. They look old, far older than the moment before. But they are happy - the relief on all their faces is clear to see. A ship lands in the distance, and the group sets off.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_12	{I see the stranger turn away from the portal, but it clearly pains them. The recording shows their reluctant steps away from the threshold, their repeated glances back over their shoulder.
The recording continues as the crew and the stranger part ways. The group heads towards a settlement in the distance, the stranger towards the empty horizon.
As the images jump forwards, the stranger spends their time hauling large red minerals to a small shelter. They carve them endlessly, a parade of geometric shapes rendered in crimson stone. They fall down, exhausted.
I cannot fathom any meaning from the glyphs they carve.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_13	{I see the stranger tap tentatively at the portal's control panel. They open the gateway and walk across the threshold.
As the foam settles, another being approaches the still-active portal. A traveller, their face obscured by a blinding light. They follow the stranger into the portal's blue light.
The structure's ancient stone bends and warps, buckling under some extreme force. At last, the traveller re-emerges. The portal closes. There is no sign of the stranger.
Though this is a recording, I cannot help the feeling that the traveller has noticed me. I close the terminal quickly.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_14	{I see the stranger turn their back on the portal and hurry away quickly. They return to the wreck of their small starship and begin entering data into the distress beacon. I see the red crimson orb...
The recording cuts out, placing the stranger back at the portal. It just shows this loop over and over. I search for an error, some corruption in the data that would explain this odd loop. I find none.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_15	{I see the stranger input a series of glyphs, then step forwards into the portal. Before the gateway closes, I see another figure enter, a shimmering being, their face obscured by a brilliant light. The recording cuts out, interrupted by a burst of static.
When the recording returns, the stranger is aboard their ship, before we ever made contact. There is a Korvax on the bridge. With a jolt, I realise it is Nada. They look extremely concerned. Before I can see more, the terminal begins to glow white hot, the screen consumed by a burning white flame.}
NPC_COMM_WEEK_06_STORY_END_16	{I see the stranger turn away from the portal. They walk slowly, tired and unsure. Eventually, they wander back to the site of their crashed ship.
I look closely at the distress beacon at the crash site. There is a faint red light spilling from its interior, the haunting crimson I have seen so many times before.
The stranger paces around the beacon, unsleeping. They continue their vigil for days. They walk slower and slower, and eventually collapse. As they do so, their fallen body takes on the same red glow.
The recording ends.}

PLANET_SCAN_TREE_DESC	{Much of what they said was difficult to understand. It seems that they require geological data, probes of the minerals that litter this system.

Despite the translation issues, one thing was clear: there is a substantial reward on offer for any explorer who supplies this data.}
PLANET_KILL_ROBOTS_DESC	{They seemed possessed of a real anger, a hatred towards the Sentinels that swarm across their planet. The lifeform was unable to leave their post, but offered to reward me should I find and destroy Sentinel forces.}

PLANET_KILL_CRE_DESC	{The lifeform seemed bored, tired of their life locked away inside their outpost. They mentioned something about the smell of mordite.

The conversation was difficult to track, but they appear to want me to hunt for them. They offered a substantial reward should I venture out and kill the creatures that roam this world.}
PLANET_FEED_CRE_DESC	{They spoke to me of their love of the outside world, of how much it pained them to be locked away inside. They related some long and difficult to follow tale of a small creature that appeared to be their pet.

They seem to be offering me a large reward should I wander the planet and feed any wild animals I come across.}
PLANET_DIGGING_DESC	{They babbled excitedly, talking of some ancient ruin that showed great promise. They showed me their data, the clue that had put them on the trail of this artifact.

They are not able to go looking for it themselves, so request that I do so on their behalf. They say I will be able to keep the artifact for myself, as long as I log any important historical discoveries in their name.}
PLANET_COLLECT_DESC	{They seemed agitated, in great need of a particular substance. For reasons I do not understand, they are unable to leave their post to collect it for themselves.

They have offered a generous reward should I collect it on their behalf and return it to their outpost.}
PLANET_DELIVER_DESC	{They have an item they claim needs delivering, but they are unable to make the journey themselves. They seem afraid of something, though I was not able to determine exactly what.

They have offered a substantial reward should I successfully make the delivery on their behalf.}
PLANET_DEPOT_DESC	{They babbled a set of coordinates, pointing excitedly at a map. They seem to have identified a resource depot. For reasons I did not understand, they seem excited at the prospect of this depot being destroyed.

They offer me a generous payment should I destroy this depot for them.}
PLANET_RAID_DESC	{They talked to me in serious tones, pointing out a nearby factory. Something about this installation has troubled them deeply, for it seems they want it raided.

The lifeform offered a substantial reward should I infiltrate the facility and access its data banks. They warn me to expect the Sentinels to respond with force.}
PLANET_MISSING_DESC	{It was difficult to understand their exact meaning, but it seems as if a colleague of theirs has gone missing. They are distressed, and seek help in tracking them down.

They offer me a large reward should I help them locate their missing 'friend'.}

You are your own master, Traveller. I will not force you to do anything.}
NPC_EXOTUT_DAILY_DONE_DESC	{They spend their days doing this now, tending to the Exocraft and drawing data from interplanetary networks. Sometimes I see them walking out into the planet itself to explore, but such times are rare. 

The technician is content with this retirement, engaging in its fugitive activity for the pleasure of the chase, no longer for the necessity of survival. It is a game we can repeat, one last heist after one last heist...}

We are pleased, delighted, renewed, to see your return, stranger.
And the others out there? Did you meet all sorts? Prospector, Ensign, Analyst - a boundless universe to befriend?}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DONE_2	{Friend! Does your lexicon overflow? How has the chatter between beings evolved these past Sols?}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DONE_3	{Aha! You have sampled the economies of many systems, bartered to beat the Trade Lords' pricing?
Ready now to rival any Magnate-Gek, yes?}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DONE_4	{Would the outlaws hear reason, friend? Could you identify the seed of this violence?}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DONE_5	{Was there data to mine from the wreckage of the patrol-drones, the bounding quadripeds, the striding collossi? And... and friend is unharmed?}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DONE_6	{This exosuit has weathered some storms now, yes? Many extreme Sols endured, your life still preserved?}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_DONE_7	{Already you have seen the entire galaxy?
Aha, no alarm, just a Gek's failing humour. But out there - you warped far, like us, like our anomaly?}

TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_RES_A_1	{Polo pores over the data, muttering bitterly at variations they are already familiar with, cheering at those they are not. 

Finally Polo applauds wildly, and offers to craft me a new technology. They claim that we are now bonded in 'glorious friendship'.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_2	{The Gek runs an instrument over my head, their hands trembling with excitement. Polo then turns to fiddle with their arcane machinery, offering me another choice of technology.}

TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_RES_A_4	{Polo seems upset at the data I send through. They do not understand why all of this killing, all of this bloodshed was necessary.

TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_RES_A_6	{Polo seems unconvinced by my claims of longevity, wondering aloud if I am some Sentinel-made replica. 

They check me over thoroughly, then offer a huge grin. They seem excited about whatever they have discovered, offering me the gift of new technology.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_7	{Before taking the Warp data, Polo gazes deep into my eyes, trying to discern if I am changed by my long travels. They release a wistful sigh, and then offer a new technology.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_RES_A_8	{With infectious enthusiasm, Polo browses the creature scans, and we find ourselves cooing and laughing together at some of the stranger species.

They offer me a technology of their own design. Polo says that they have no more use for it...}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_RES_A_9	{Polo stares at length at the images of each species, watching their movements and listening to their words. Every lifeform that shows the slightest individuality appears to have something wrong with them, some sickness within.

They offer me my reward with a subtle sadness, claiming there are no new friends to be found. They begin to cough.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_RES_A_10	{I present the proof of my linguistic advancement. Polo bursts into tears.

They say they wish I remembered my old life, our old times together. I ask Polo what they mean, but they claim they cannot talk about it.
They claim that they have said too much, and return to their standard offer of new technology.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_11	{Polo does not even ask for my research data this time. The Gek simply congratulates me for my success and then offers me a gift. I am none the wiser.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_12	{There is mingled guilt and relief in the Gek's bright eyes as they hand me another blueprint. Whether or not their intentions are honest, Polo does not want to see me harmed.
They offer to create me a new piece of technology, to protect me on my travels.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_RES_A_13	{Polo silently bundles me into a hug when I return, and this time I do not recoil. I do not ask why, either. There are tears in the Gek's eyes.
They thank me for saving their lives, however brief the respite.
Polo turns to their machinery, hoping to craft me something in thanks.}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_14	{Polo is rapt with envy as I recount tales of the monstrous climates I have endured, of horrendous travels through burning rain and choking heat. What peculiar jealousy.
They feel inspired to create some new technological marvel, and offer me the results.}
TRA_NPC_U3ANOMALY_RES_A_15	{Polo tells me that they are glad I have seen so much with my own eyes. Wonder is a rare but dangerous gift. Polo gives me a new piece of technology to light my way...}
TRA_NPC_ANOMALY_RES_A_16	{Polo puts the data to one side and turns to the window. For a time, we watch the stars together, my friend and I. We clasp hands, and then I go to leave. There is more to see.
Polo stops me. Although the gift barely matters, the Gek does not want to break our pattern. The nod at me, and at their machinery.}

TRA_NPC_WAIT_LINK_4	{I have spent many hours thinking of all the ships you destroyed. It is time for some fresh task, yes?}
TRA_NPC_WAIT_LINK_5	{The data you gathered from your fight with the Sentinels has been processed and noted, friend. Let us move on.}
TRA_NPC_WAIT_LINK_6	{Did your travels help you recover? The data you found on your extreme journey gave me much joy, but it is stained with the trouble it caused. Some new task will refresh us both, yes?}
TRA_NPC_WAIT_LINK_7	{All those systems, those stars, such time spent between worlds, living in the light...your warp data was fascinating, friend! Shall we continue our work together?}
TRA_NPC_WAIT_LINK_8	{The animals you found me were a real comfort, friend. Their lives may continue in the anomaly, long after they might otherwise have passed... But it is time for some new work, yes?}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_1	{We sought an escape from reality. That’s why we’re all here, isn’t it?

I can remember what it was like, to be a Traveller. To have that hope, that intolerable thirst for the new...

I should never have listened to you, my love. There is no fire in this place, no trophies fit for gods. There is only darkness. The family of glass, they watch everything...}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_2	{Did it know what I had done to it? Was it angry? Upset? Alone? Afraid? Could a Sentinel feel such things?

It hovered before me, its light catching upon a thousand crystal shards all around. And as I moved on, it travelled by my side.

That night I dreamt of the warp cage, but there was no more pain within. The drone looked at me, and I knew that I had been forgiven. I had fixed it. I had answered for my sin.

I shall call it Laylaps.}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_3	{We see the Sentinels swarm across the void, warping in and out of this dimension at the will of some unknown force, depositing the echoes of the dead within the archives.

Laylaps does not join the others. It just stares at me, its light still shining unaltered, unabated. It is a comfort to me.}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_4	{I found them standing over me as I awoke, their beak chattering, their eyes caught between horror and joy.

It was the tallest Gek I had ever seen, but the mystery was soon solved. They asked me of the Empire – they wanted to know if the First Spawn still spoke their name. In life they had possessed a hundred Korvax slaves, you see.
They do not remember how they arrived in this place. Their face swarms with nanites. They are lonely.}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_5	{The three of us journeyed to the centre: the Sentinel, the First Spawn, and the Traveller, all children of the ATLAS, all hoping for some answer in the void.

The First Spawn would not stop talking, would not stop glorifying their cruel life of brutality and pain. One night they sang a song, a tale of a lost people, of an armada of freighters fleeing the abyss.

Of a world where every Sentinel turned against every living thing, annihilating them all within moments. Laylaps showed no sign of understanding. It did not leave us, nor did it try and explain.

Perhaps the Sentinels were right.}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_6	{The First Spawn fought valiantly, but there was no saving them. The nanites had found their place within, protruding outward through every pore, through every limb and every thought.

And it was done. They departed with the family of glass, forever lost to this world, their story at an end.

I ventured on. We were almost there.}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_7	{Something was very wrong. The ATLAS interface had grown still, its orb cold and almost grey. The computers did not respond. Nothing did.

It took a few moments before I realised that Laylaps was gone.

I was alone.}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_8	{I heard the music again this morning – that same signal that led me to this realm. I stood and listened, honing my instruments to find the source, expecting some different result, but what use was science here?

If a computer is on fire, what good are the prayers of data?}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_9	{They had captured my friend. I saw them from a distance, the family of glass in all their majesty, cradling the fallen Sentinel, its light flickering in their awful embrace.

I let out an involuntary cry as they cut into its exoskeleton, and each vacant stare, each grin of malice turned to me.

I fled, but it was no use. They numbered in the hundreds. They found me.}
UI_U4_TRAVELLER_LOG_10	{It was Laylaps - Laylaps who I had doubted, Laylaps who I had harmed and fixed, Laylaps who was my salvation! It tore us both from that awful place, warping us back to the universe, to our universe!

The first Traveller in history to escape the World of Glass, to be reclaimed from death itself! It is kindness that saves us all, don’t you think? Laylaps told me everything, speaking through my very exosuit! 

I will see you soon, my friend. Together at last! What tales they will tell of us! I am transmitting the glyphs now. I can’t wait for you to meet my new friends...}

NPC_EGUILD_GREET_UNKNOWN_DESC_1	{The lifeform carries both the badge of the Explorers Guild and the worldly pose of one who has broken ground on many strange planets.
For a supposedly curious lifeform, I do not seem to provoked much interest. Perhaps they deem me unworthy of study.}
NPC_EGUILD_GREET_UNKNOWN_DESC_2	{I have seen this alien's insignia before. They are a member of the Explorers Guild.
They do not seem interested in the data I have to offer. Perhaps the <SPECIAL>Mission Listings Agent<> on the station might have a way to prove my worth?}

NPC_EGUILD_GREET_MED_DESC_1	{The lifeform flashes a small holographic display, a 3D token of their status as the Explorers Guild envoy in this system.}
NPC_EGUILD_GREET_MED_DESC_2	{The alien reveals their Explorers Guild credentials, the paperwork of an official envoy.}

NPC_EGUILD_GREET_BEST_DESC_2	{The alien greets me with a selection of interesting images taken in this system. As the Explorers Guild envoy here, they are keen that I see the sights.}
NPC_EGUILD_GREET_BEST_DESC_3	{The lifeform scans me, scans themselves, and finally scans the Explorers Guild insignia they have projected in front of them. The ritual over, they bow before me.}
NPC_WGUILD_GREET_UNKNOWN_DESC_1	{The alien's aggressive tone and rough demeanor mark them out as a mercenary. I hope they are here in some official capacity, rather than undertaking a mission.}
NPC_WGUILD_GREET_UNKNOWN_DESC_2	{The lifeform glares at me briefly, shaking their head. They seem to be a representative of the Guild of Mercenaries.
Perhaps I could impress them by undertaking work from the <SPECIAL>Mission Listings Agent<>?}
NPC_WGUILD_GREET_LOW_DESC_1	{The alien gives a terse salute. Their insignia is of a middle-ranking officer of the Mercenaries Guild.}
NPC_WGUILD_GREET_LOW_DESC_2	{The lifeform barks at me in a grumpy tone. Their badge shows them as an envoy of the Mercenaries Guild.}
NPC_WGUILD_GREET_LOW_DESC_3	{The alien looks at me, disappointed. They are an official of the Mercenaries Guild, and I think they expected me to salute.}
NPC_WGUILD_GREET_MED_DESC_1	{The alien, wearing the uniform of a Mercenaries Guild envoy, looks me up and down. I appear to pass muster.}
NPC_WGUILD_GREET_MED_DESC_2	{The lifeform, a gruff look upon their face, welcomes me to the system on behalf of the Mercenaries Guild.}

NPC_GUILD_MISSION_OFFER_DESC_3	{They transmit specific data, a mission that they cannot entrust to the listings agent. They hope I will be of assistance.}
NPC_GUILD_MISSION_OFFER_DESC_4	{They appear to have a problem client, one with a task they feel they can only entrust to a Guild member in good standing.}
NPC_GUILD_MISSION_OFFER_DESC_5	{They offer me the chance to take on a particularly lucrative mission, a task for a favoured client.}

NPC_GUILD_TITHE_OFFER_DESC_3	{They present me with my share of recent Guild profits, accounting for my rank.}
NPC_GUILD_TITHE_OFFER_DESC_4	{Their greeting over, the envoy turns to business. They tally up what I am due from the Guild, my share of recent profits minus membership fees owed.}

NPC_GUILD_PRESENT_OFFER_DESC_2	{They have no specific work for me at the moment. They seem apologetic, and offer me a small gift as recompense.}

DNT_EXP_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_LAN	{Eheu! Ship is new, pristine! Repairs will be most costly. Transfer units immediately!}
DNT_TRA_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_LAN	{Friend! This is not friendly behaviour. Make amends with friendly units, yes?}
DNT_TRA_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_LAN	{Only trade goods, friend, not lasers. This is a good rule, yes?}
DNT_TRA_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_LAN	{What is the meaning of this?! I only wish to trade in peace. Do not anger me, friend!}
DNT_WAR_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_LAN	{Vy'keen is forbidden from harming the interloper, but this attack is outrageous! Cease before I am forced to attack!}

DNT_WAR_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_LAN	{The last fool to damage my ship did not live to regret their assault! Test me and face death! Grah!}
ALL_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_DESC_1	{The trader gestures angrily, furious at having been assaulted. They demand I make amends.}
ALL_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_DESC_2	{Waving aggressively, the trader demands an apology. They appear to be threatening me with some sort of retribution.}
ALL_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_DESC_3	{The trader's gestures suggest they are offering me a chance to apologise for my actions. I am not sure how they will take it if I do not.}
ALL_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_DESC_4	{The pilot gesticulates wildly, outraged that they have been fired upon. This is my chance to apologise, should I wish to.}
ALL_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_DESC_5	{I am unfamiliar with the full range of alien gestures, but none of these seem very happy.}
ALL_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_DESC_6	{The pilot is unimpressed with my actions, though they seem to be offering me a chance to apologise. There is a threat lurking behind their words, I feel.}
ALL_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_OPT_A	{Apologise}
ALL_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_OPT_B	{Continue to attack}
ALL_TRADER_DEMAND_SORRY_RES_A_1	{My apology, and my units, appear to have calmed the trader.}

DNT_WAR_TRADER_SUBMIT_LANG_3	{Grah! Vy'keen will comply with the Traveller's wishes. You want my cargo?}
ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_DESC_1	{Begging for their life, the trader frantically gestures for me to cease my assault.}
ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_DESC_2	{The trader babbles, panic-stricken, begging me to stop. They appear to be offering me some sort of tribute.}
ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_DESC_3	{It is hard to make sense of their message, but the panicked trader appears to be trying to negotiate.}
ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_DESC_4	{The pilot pleads with me, seemingly offering their cargo in exchange for their life.}
ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_DESC_5	{Wide-eyed and breathing heavily, the trader seems relieved to have made contact. They seem to be believe I might be persuaded to show mercy...}

ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_RES_A_4	{The trader transmits their payment, good to their word. I should leave them be, if I am to be true to mine...}
ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_RES_A_5	{The pilot transfers their cargo as quickly as possible, keen to get as far away from me as possible.}

ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_RES_B_3	{I have no need of this trader's random assortment of cargo. Their ship is worth far more as scrap...}
ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_RES_C_1	{Defiance flashes across the pilot's face. They break off communications, having used this time to call for help.}
ALL_TRADER_SUBMIT_RES_C_2	{The terror in the trader's eyes turns to anger. I see their ships weapons coming online. They never intended to pay me...}

ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_DESC_1	{The threatening look in the pilot's eyes tells me all I need to know. They are not interested in trading...}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_DESC_2	{My contact appears to have alerted the pilot to the value of ship and its cargo. There is a dangerous glint in their eyes.}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_DESC_3	{The pilot's angry gestures suggest they are in no mood for peaceful trading. I seem to have a fight on my hands.}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_DESC_4	{The 'trader' I have disturbed appears in no mood for trading. As they speak, I see them begin to arm their weapons.}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_DESC_5	{Though they fly a trader's flag, this pilot is clearly no humble merchant. Even over the communicator's static, I can sense their pirate swagger.}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_OPT_A	{Begin combat}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_OPT_B	{Offer tribute}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_RES_A_1	{A real pirate would have attacked on sight. This trader is nothing but a cowardly opportunist.}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_RES_A_2	{This 'pirate' offered a lot of angry sounding words. Let's see what else they have to offer...}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_RES_A_3	{I will not be bullied by some scheming trader. If they want a fight, they shall have one.}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_RES_B_1	{The 'trader' accepts my offer. I write it off as the cost of doing business in dangerous space.}
ALL_TRADER_HOSTILE_RES_B_2	{My offer seems to have calmed the trader. We leave each other in peace, at least for now.}

ALL_TRADER_AMBUSH_DESC_3	{The trader looks tired. They speak hurriedly, apparently outlining some problem or another. They seem to need my help.}
ALL_TRADER_AMBUSH_DESC_4	{Nervous, the pilot delivers some pre-prepared speech. It seems like some sort of plea for help. They gesture as they finish, waiting for a response.}
ALL_TRADER_AMBUSH_DESC_5	{The trader is demanding help, that much is clear. It is hard to make out the exact problem, but it seems of utmost importance that I move in close to their ship...}
ALL_TRADER_AMBUSH_DESC_6	{The trader seems to be asking for help, their ship apparently damaged in some crucial way. But their eyes are hard and mean, showing no relief at their rescue.}

ALL_TRADER_AMBUSH_RES_A_2	{I move in close, as requested, but the radio falls silent. As I try to hail the trader, I notice their weapon systems coming online...}
ALL_TRADER_AMBUSH_RES_A_3	{I attempt to comply with the trader's request, but they remain evasive. My pulse engine begins to stutter, and my radar displays a collection of unknown signals approaching fast...}
ALL_TRADER_AMBUSH_RES_B_1	{The trader's manner is highly suspicious. I leave them be, and prepare to warp away before any trouble begins.}
ALL_TRADER_AMBUSH_RES_B_2	{This situation is highly suspicious. Despite their pleas, I prepare to leave this trader where they float.}
