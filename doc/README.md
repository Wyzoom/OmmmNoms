# Documentation

Two kinds of documentation are present here :
* Mission structure
* How to use the mission maker
 
## Mission structure
Stuff we learn here is consolidated and made more accesible on the NMS modding wiki 
* [MISSIONS](https://wiki.step-project.com/NMS:MISSIONS) and 
* [NPCMISSIONTABLE](https://wiki.step-project.com/NMS:NPCMISSIONTABLE.MBIN)

The files here are :
* analyze_exml.ipynb : The Jypter notebook script that processes the relevant EXML files and extracts and structures the mission logic. Its output are .txt files, with Media Wiki markup, their content can be directly placed on the NMS modding wiki
* /language/ : the EXML files containing all english language strings. Please decompile them yourself and place them here.
* /missions/ : the EXML files containing all missions and related files. Please decompile them yourself and place them here.
