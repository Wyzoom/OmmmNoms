# event_type: incoming_comm_message

The incoming signal is unlike anything you have ever seen before. Carrier frequency oscilates, modulation makes no sense. Ship is struggly to keep tracking the signal, as it is shifting across the spectrum.

With some difficulty, the communicator tunes in. There is silence at first. Then, very faint, I can hear distorted words being spoken. 
I can hear the urgency in the voice, and who, or whatever, is trying to communicate with me clearly has a lot to say.

No matter how carefully, I listen, I just can not make out the words.

I continue listening to the voice mesmerised, as the sounds continues shifting, crackling, fading in and out.  After a while, I realize tha there is a pattern in the noise. I set the ships computer to track the pattern. Yes, there is information in there!

This is the source of the anomalous transmission. There is a message waiting for me.
